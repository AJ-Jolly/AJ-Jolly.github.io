        <h2 class="h2Alt">One of the Gayest Cities in the US</h2>
        <p class="pAlt">It's estimated that Western North Carolina is home to about 35,000 people who identify as LGBTQ+, about 6,000 of whom are trangender or nonbinary. In a state where being LGBTQ means daily uncertainty, Asheville is reguarded as one of the most queer cities in the south and as a haven for many, especially those who are rejected by their loved ones. This will be a growing project, compiling and mapping locations that are considered safe spaces, resources, or a parts of the local LGBTQ culture.  </p>

It's also the plethora of queer-owned and queer friendly local buisnesses that keep it thriving. Additionally, it's the site of the annual Blue Ridge Pride festival, one of the most prominent pride events in the south.</p>

        <p class="pAlt">This region located south of downtown has been undergoing a major transition from an abondaned industrial district to a vibrant, artsy, community of local buisnesses. It's also home to many resources that have proven essential to the local WNC LGBTQ community, including the Western North Carolina AIDS Project and the WNC Community Health Services.</p>
